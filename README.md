1. File: Report Facial Recognition.ipynb

This file is the final report of our group, containg dataset description, pre-processing, methods used and conclusions.

2. File: Code Facial Recognition.ipynb 

This file contains all the code and our experimental results.

3. File: functions_used.ipynb

No need to read this file. It's function defined in file2. Just want to simplfy the procedure of importing them.

4. How to run the code.

  - First, download the dataset "icml_face_data.csv" from kaggle.

  Link is https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data?select=icml_face_data.csv

  - Second, download all the files in this repo, and put the "icml_face_data.csv" in the same folder.

  - Finally, open "Code Facial Recognition.ipynb" or "Report Facial Recognition.ipynb" and run the code.
